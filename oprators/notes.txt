` ~ expression =

 Definition:  An expression is anything that produces a value.
              Expressions can be used inside statements.
 example : 
 3 + 4           # 7 (this is an expression)
 x * 2           # if x = 5, then x * 2 = 10
 "Hello" + "!"   # "Hello!"
 

~ Statement=

Definition:  A statement is a complete instruction that performs an action.
             It does something, but may or may not return a value.
              A statement can contain expressions.
example : 
x = 5           # Assignment statement
print(x)        # Print statement
if x > 0:       # if statement

    print("Positive")

| Feature         | Expression      | Statement          
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------- |
| Purpose         | Produces a value | Performs an action  |
| Return value    | Yes              | Not always          |
| Example         | `3 + 5`          | `x = 3 + 5`         |
| Can be printed? | Yes              | No (not directly)   |
| Used in         | Statements       | Whole lines of code |
   
example of both :
x = 2 + 3
2 + 3 → Expression (evaluates to 5)
x = 2 + 3 → Statement (assigns value to x)
