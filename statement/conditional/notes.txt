conditional : 
A conditional statement is a type of programming statement that executes certain code only if a specific condition is true.
Think of it as "if this happens, then do that."

General Form: In most programming languages (like C, Java, Python, JavaScript)
it look like :
 example =  if condition:

age = 18
if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")

explanation: 
condition → age >= 18

If the condition is true, it runs the print("You are an adult.") statement.

If false, it skips it.
 

 type of conditional statement :

  // if statement → Runs code if a condition is true.
  
  // if...else → Runs one block if true, another if false.
  
  // if...elif...else → Checks multiple conditions.

  // Nested if → An if inside another if.
  
  // Switch / match (in some languages) → Runs code based on multiple fixed values.
